# Introduction to Cloud Computing
It is the delivery of computing services.Servers, Storage, Databases, Networking, Software, Analytics, Intelligence and even more.
Now all of these services whether it be servers, storage, databases etc. all of these are delivered over the Internet, that's what the cloud is.
So in cloud computing you don't need to manage those data centers.You don't need to buy physical hardware up front. So there's no capital investment from your side.You can create resources, on demand.The biggest plus point you only pay for how much ever you use and this is the future of computing.
Microsoft Azure provides you a platform wherein you can build, deploy and manage your solutions.

# Azure Core Services - Azure Virtual Machines
 The virtual machine service is known as an infrastructure as a service on the Azure platform.
 Now when you deploy a virtual machine on the Azure platform. so yes it does deploy the virtual machineresource but there are a number of other resources that get deployed along with the virtual machine.So firstly is the virtual network. so the virtual machine needs to reside in a virtual network.So this is like a home for the virtual machine.Now there is a separate section that we have on virtual networks.Now in addition to the virtual network we also have the underlying disk.So there is an OS disk that is assigned to the virtual machine.So this is used for holding the OS level data and you can add your own data disk onto the virtual machine.Apart from that there is a virtual network interface card that's assigned to the virtual machine.So all of the packets of data that's sent by the virtual machine and received by the virtual machinegoes via this network interface and the network interface can get a private and a public IP address.And then finally we also have a network security group.So this is assigned to the network interface card.So this is like a firewall.This is used to decide what is a type of traffic that flows into and out of the virtual machine.
